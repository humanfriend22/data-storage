# data-storage
A useless and very poor designed local-storage data app

So back when I only knew basic html and virtually no JavaScript, I created this "app" and I was quite proud of it.
Its been around a year and I somewhat mastered JavaScript and NodeJS. I remembered this little project I made and 
decided to move it from my previous static hosting provider Netlify, to Github Pages. 


This "app" is neither secure, safe, intuitive or anything else that might come under a good "web app".
Don't actually use this.
