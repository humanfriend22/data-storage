# data-storage
A useless and very poor designed local-storage data app

So back when I only knew basic html and virtually no JavaScript, I created this "app" and I was quite proud of it.
Its been around a year and I somewhat mastered JavaScript and NodeJS. I remembered this little project I made and 
decided to move it from my previous static hosting provider Netlify, to Github Pages. I have kept all the code the exact same 
except for the external file names and nested folders.


This "app" is neither secure, safe, intuitive or anything else that might come under a good "web app".
Don't actually use this.
